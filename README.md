To load TPC-LoS, TPC-multitask, LSTM, and Transformer model, navigate to bdeleon2 and start a local runtime notebook. You can connect to our ipynb on colab with the notebook (https://research.google.com/colaboratory/local-runtimes.html) and run the models. Must be on Python 3.6 and meet the `requirements.txt`. Make sure the paths.json is set correctly. Currently only trained on MIMIC.
