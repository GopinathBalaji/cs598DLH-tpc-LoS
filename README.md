# cs598DLH-tpc-LoS

To load TPC-LoS, TPC-multitask, LSTM, and Transformer model, navigate to bdeleon2 and start a local runtime notebook. You can connect to our ipynb on colab with the notebook (https://research.google.com/colaboratory/local-runtimes.html) and run the models. Must be on Python 3.6 and meet the `requirements.txt`. Make sure the paths.json is set correctly to where your pre-processed data is. Currently only trained on MIMIC. Pre-processing instructions can be found in bdeleon2 in their respective folders.


If running the limited tests, insert the test files into the test directory inside whichever path you set up the MIMIC data on.
