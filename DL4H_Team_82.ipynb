        "*   Background of the problem\n",
        "  <!-- * what type of problem: disease/readmission/mortality prediction,  feature engineeing, data processing, etc\n",
        "  * what is the importance/meaning of solving the problem\n",
        "  * what is the difficulty of the problem\n",
        "  * the state of the art methods and effectiveness. -->\n",
        "  * Intensive Care Units (ICU) are critical areas within hospitals that require intensive management due to the high cost and limited availability of resources such as beds and specialized staff.\n",
        "  * The management of hospital beds, particularly in the ICU, is a critical challenge due to budget constraints and increasing patient demand.\n",
        "  * Efficient resource allocation in the ICU is crucial because it involves life-support services for critically ill patients.\n",
        "  * Predicting the length of stay (LoS) of patients in the ICU is vital to optimize these resources.\n",
        "  * However, this prediction task is complex due to the high variability among patients and the dynamic nature of clinical environments.\n",
        "  * Furthermore, the task is compounded by the logistical difficulties associated with managing high-demand and limited-capacity environments.\n",
        "  * The prediction of patient outcomes like disease progression, readmission, mortality, and length of stay has seen increasing application of machine learning models leveraging Electronic Health Records (EHR).\n",
        "  * These models, including state-of-the-art approaches like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformers, aim to harness the temporal dynamics and rich patient data available in EHRs.\n",
        "  * Despite their advancements, these methods face significant challenges, such as handling irregularly sampled data, dealing with missing values, and adapting to the skewness in data distributions.\n",
        "  * The limitations of current methodologies underscore the need for innovative approaches that can improve accuracy and reliability in LoS predictions, thus facilitating better ICU bed management and enhancing patient care quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "  <!-- * State-of-the-art methods for LoS prediction primarily include machine learning models that utilize Electronic Health Records (EHR), such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformer models.\n",
        "  * These methods focus on overcoming challenges related to the irregularity and missingness of EHR data, yet they struggle with issues like data skewness and the necessity for frequent updates based on new incoming data. -->\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Paper explanation\n",
        "  <!-- * what did the paper propose\n",
        "  * what is the innovations of the method\n",
        "  * how well the proposed method work (in its own metrics)\n",
        "  * what is the contribution to the reasearch regime (referring the Background above, how important the paper is to the problem). -->\n",
        "  <!-- * The paper introduced a novel deep learning model named Temporal Pointwise Convolution (TPC), designed to enhance the prediction of ICU stay lengths by addressing specific challenges inherent in EHR data. TPC integrates temporal convolution to handle dependencies across time and pointwise convolution to extract high-level feature interactions.\n",
        "  * The innovation in TPC lies in its dual approach, combining temporal and pointwise convolutions. This design allows it to effectively handle the skewness and irregular sampling inherent in EHR data, providing a more robust framework for feature extraction compared to existing methods.\n",
        "  * The proposed TPC model demonstrates substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over traditional models like LSTM and Transformer. It achieved a mean absolute deviation in LoS predictions significantly lower than these benchmarks, illustrating its effectiveness in real-world settings.\n",
        "  * The TPC model contributes significantly to the ICU resource management field by providing a more accurate and reliable method for predicting patient LoS. By improving prediction accuracy, the model aids in better resource allocation and operational planning in hospitals, addressing the critical need outlined in the paper's background. This advancement is particularly important given the increasing pressure on ICU resources and the potential impact of accurate predictions on patient outcomes and hospital efficiency. -->\n",
        "  * The study introduces a novel machine learning model termed Temporal Pointwise Convolution (TPC), specifically designed to address the unique challenges posed by ICU stay data. This model combines the strengths of temporal convolutional layers, which process time-series data to capture temporal dependencies, and pointwise convolutional layers, which analyze and integrate features at each time step independently. This hybrid approach is crafted to enhance the model's ability to interpret complex, irregular, and sparse datasets typically found in ICU EHRs.\n",
        "  * The TPC model's primary innovation lies in its unique architecture that effectively integrates temporal and pointwise convolutions. This design allows the model to handle the prevalent skewness and irregularities in ICU data more robustly than traditional models. By processing temporal and feature-based information simultaneously, TPC can extract more nuanced patterns and interactions that are crucial for accurate prediction.\n",
        "  * Empirical results demonstrate that the TPC model significantly outperforms traditional predictive models such as LSTMs and Transformers on several key metrics. For instance, the model shows improvements in mean absolute deviation of LoS predictions, highlighting its practical effectiveness in a real-world clinical setting. The success of the TPC model in these evaluations illustrates its potential to enhance decision-making processes in ICU management.\n",
        "  * The development and validation of the TPC model represent a significant advancement in the field of health informatics, particularly in the predictive modeling of ICU patient LoS. By offering a more accurate and reliable method for predicting how long patients will stay in the ICU, this model contributes to better resource allocation, potentially leading to cost reductions and improved patient outcomes. The research provides a critical tool for healthcare providers, helping them to optimize ICU operations amid increasing patient demands and finite resources. This contribution is not only a technical achievement but also a practical solution to a pressing healthcare challenge.\n",

        "  * Data was divided such that 70% was used for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing, ensuring no patient overlap between these sets.\n",
        "  * Both datasets include labels for length of stay and in-hospital mortality, with the specifics of these distributions tailored to reflect the critical conditions and care requirements in ICUs.\n",

        "  * Only features present in at least a certain percentage of patient stays were included. Variables from lab results, vital signs, and nurse charting inputs were among those analyzed.\n",

        "### ExperimentTemplate Code:\n",
        "\n",
        "The `ExperimentTemplate` class is a structured framework designed to manage and execute machine learning experiments, particularly for training, validating, and testing models using PyTorch. This template is tailored for handling tasks such as predicting hospital Length of Stay (LoS) and mortality, potentially in a multitask setting. Here's a detailed breakdown of its components and functionalities:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Components and Functionalities\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Initialization and Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Device Configuration:** The template checks if CUDA is available (i.e., if a GPU is available and not disabled in the configuration) and sets the appropriate device (GPU or CPU) for tensor computations.\n",
        "- **Data Readers:** Depending on the dataset specified in the configuration (MIMIC or eICU), it initializes data readers for training, validation, and testing datasets. These readers handle data loading and preprocessing tailored to the specific needs of each dataset.\n",
        "- **Model and Optimizer:** It initializes placeholders for the model and optimizer, which will be defined in subclasses or during the experiment setup phase.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Training Process\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Batch Processing:** The training method processes data in batches. If enabled, it shuffles training data at the beginning of each epoch to ensure diversity in mini-batch samples throughout training epochs.\n",
        "- **Loss Computation and Backpropagation:** For each batch, the model's predictions for LoS and mortality (if applicable) are computed. The loss is calculated using a custom loss function that may incorporate different components depending on the task (e.g., MSE for LoS and binary cross-entropy for mortality). The gradients are then propagated back through the network, and the optimizer updates the model parameters.\n",
        "- **Metrics Calculation:** After processing all batches, metrics such as Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and others are calculated and logged for monitoring the training process.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Validation and Testing\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Evaluation:** Similar to training, but without backpropagation or parameter updates. It's used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data, ensuring that the model generalizes well beyond the training dataset.\n",
        "- **Metrics Logging:** For both validation and testing phases, performance metrics are calculated and logged. This can include regression metrics for LoS and classification metrics for mortality.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Utility Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Data Padding Removal:** A utility function to remove padding from sequences, ensuring that only valid time steps contribute to loss and metric calculations.\n",
        "- **Custom Logging:** Extensions to the logging mechanism to support different data formats, such as saving outputs directly to CSV files.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Experiment Management\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Checkpointing:** The template includes mechanisms to save and load model checkpoints, allowing experiments to be paused and resumed. This is crucial for long-running experiments, especially when computational resources might be interrupted.\n",
        "- **Result Reporting:** At the end of testing, results are compiled and written to a CSV file, providing a permanent record of the experiment's outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "The `ExperimentTemplate` is designed to be a base class. Specific experiments inherit from this template and override or extend its methods to accommodate particular models, datasets, or experimental procedures. This structured approach ensures that all experiments maintain a consistent methodology, facilitating easier debugging, replication of results, and modifications for new tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Define a new experiment class inheriting from `ExperimentTemplate`.\n",
        "2. Override the `setup_template` method to initialize model-specific components.\n",
        "3. Optionally override the `train`, `validate`, and `test` methods to customize the training loop or evaluation procedures.\n",
        "\n",
        "This template serves as a foundational tool in our machine learning workflow, ensuring that experiments are conducted systematically and that results are reproducible and well-documented.\n"

        "This script is designed to configure and manage the command-line arguments for different machine learning experiments, specifically tailored for models like TPC, LSTM, and Transformer. This script uses the argparse library to define and parse command-line options, facilitating flexible experimentation with different configurations. Here's a brief overview of its functionality:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### General Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Base Configuration:** Defines general settings applicable across different models, such as dataset selection, CUDA usage, batch sizes, and task-specific settings (e.g., LoS, mortality, multitask).\n",
        "- **Loss and Ablation Settings:** Configures options for loss functions and various ablation studies (e.g., using only lab data, excluding masks or diagnoses).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Model-Specific Arguments\n",
        "\n",
        "- **TPC Arguments:** Adds specific settings for the Temporal Pointwise Convolutional Network, such as the number of epochs, layers, kernel size, and learning rate.\n",
        "- **LSTM Arguments:** Configures LSTM-specific parameters like the number of layers, hidden size, and whether the LSTM is bidirectional.\n",
        "- **Transformer Arguments:** Sets up Transformer-specific options including the number of layers, model dimension 1, number of attention heads, and dropout rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Utility Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "- **gen_config:** Converts parsed arguments into a configuration object that can be easily accessed throughout the code.\n",
        "- **Dataset-Specific Adjustments:** Automatically adjusts certain parameters based on the dataset (e.g., setting no_diag to True for the MIMIC dataset).\n"

        "#### Metrics descriptions\n",
        "In this project, we use several metrics to evaluate the performance of our models. These metrics help us to understand how well our models are performing in terms of accuracy, error rate, and other aspects of predictive modeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "For *Length of Stay Prediction* task, we report on the following 6 metrics:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   **Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD):** The average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values, providing a straightforward measure of prediction error. Represents the average error in the same units as the predicted variable (days of stay). **Lower MAD is better**, indicating that the model's predictions are closer to the true values.\n",
        "2.   **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):** The average of the absolute percentage differences between predictions and actual values, which normalizes errors by the actual values. Expresses the error as a percentage of the true values. **Lower MAPE is better**, suggesting that the model's predictions are more accurate relative to the scale of the Length of Stay.\n",
        "3.   **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average of the squares of the errors—that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value. Heavily penalizes larger errors due to squaring the error terms. **Lower MSE is better**, as it indicates that the model makes fewer and less significant errors in prediction.\n",
        "5.   **Mean Squared Log Error (MSLE):** Similar to MSE but takes the log of the predictions and actual values before calculating the mean squared difference, penalizing underestimates more than overestimates. Less sensitive to large errors and focuses more on the relative error. **Lower MSLE is better**, especially when you care more about percentage errors than absolute differences.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.   **Coefficient of Determination (R<sup>2</sup>):**  Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.Indicates how well the independent variables explain the variance in the dependent variable. **Higher R² is better**, with a maximum of 1. A higher R² means the model explains more of the variability in the Length of Stay.\n",
        "7.   **Cohen Kappa Score:** Assesses the agreement between two raters, where the ratings are the discretized bins of the predicted and actual values.Measures the agreement between the discretized predictions and true values, taking into account the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance. **Higher Cohen Kappa Score** is better, indicating stronger agreement.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "For *In-Hospital Mortality* and *Multitask* tasks we report:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   **Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC):** Represents the likelihood of the model distinguishing between the positive and negative classes.\n",
        "2.   **Area Under the Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC):** Reflects the trade-off between precision and recall for different thresholds, a useful measure for imbalanced datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "These functions are called with the true values and the model predictions to output the metrics for evaluation. Each of these metrics provides different insights into the performance of the models and are used accordingly based on whether the task is regression or classification."

        "The best hyperparameters are determined through a process of hyperparameter tuning, which involves running a series of experiments with different combinations of hyperparameters to find the set that yields the best performance on a validation set. The below code snippet contains functions that return a configuration dictionary with the best hyperparameters for different models and datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a high-level overview of how the best hyperparameters are obtained and set:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Global Hyperparameters:** The `best_global` function sets hyperparameters that are common across all models, such as `alpha`, `main_dropout_rate`, `last_linear_size`, and `batch_norm`. These are set based on the dataset being used (e.g., 'eICU' or 'MIMIC').\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Model-Specific Hyperparameters:** Functions like `best_tpc`, `best_lstm`, `best_cw_lstm`, and `best_transformer` set hyperparameters specific to each model type. These functions first call `best_global` to set the global hyperparameters and then set additional hyperparameters that are specific to the model and dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Conditional Hyperparameters:** Within each model-specific function, there are conditional statements that set hyperparameters based on the dataset, task, or percentage of data used. For example, the number of epochs might change depending on whether the task is 'mortality' or the amount of data used.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Hyperparameter Tuning Experiments:** The best hyperparameters are likely obtained from a series of experiments where different hyperparameter values are tried out. These experiments are typically run using the above function `get_hyperparam_config`. The results of these experiments are analyzed to determine which hyperparameters work best.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Adoption of Best Hyperparameters:** Once the best hyperparameters are identified, they are hardcoded into the below code so that they can be easily used for the final experiments.\n",
        "\n",
        "To use the best hyperparameters in an experiment, you would import the appropriate function and pass your configuration dictionary to it. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Initialize your config dictionary with basic settings\n",
        "config = {'dataset': 'eICU', 'task': 'mortality', ...}\n",
        "\n",
        "# Get the best hyperparameters for the TPC model\n",
        "config = best_tpc(config)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This process ensures that the final experiments are run with the hyperparameters that have been empirically found to perform the best."

        "## Implications of the Experimental Results\n",
        "\n",
        "The experimental results indicate that the Temporal Pointwise Convolutional (TPC) model outperforms LSTM and transformer models for predicting length of stay (LoS) in the ICU, as shown in the original paper. The multitask TPC model, which predicts both LoS and mortality, also performed well, confirming the hypotheses of the original paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Reproducibility of the Original Paper\n",
        "\n",
        "The original paper appears to be reproducible to a certain extent. The provided code snippets and the structure of the experiment template suggest that the authors followed a systematic approach to model training, validation, and testing, which is conducive to reproducibility.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **What Was Easy**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Data Preprocessing:** The preprocessing steps for both eICU and MIMIC datasets were well-documented, making it easy to prepare the data for model training.\n",
        "- **Model Initialization:** Initializing the TPC model with the best hyperparameters was straightforward due to the clear documentation and the `initialise_arguments` function provided.\n",
        "- **Training and Evaluation:** The `ExperimentTemplate` class provided a structured way to train and evaluate the models, which simplified these processes. Running training was relatively easy once everything else was figured out.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **What Was Difficult**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Finding the best hyperparameters might be challenging without a clear understanding of the search space or the computational resources required. Additionally, downgrading to Python 3.6 along with the libraries was difficult.\n",
        "- **Interpretability:** Visualizing and interpreting model predictions and importances was complex, as it required a deep understanding of the model's internals and the use of additional tools like Integrated Gradients.\n",
        "- **Environment Setup:** Ensuring that the correct versions of libraries and dependencies were installed could be a hurdle, as the codebase might not be fully compatible with the latest versions. Loading the model was challenging due to outdated libraries and custom loaders.\n",
        "- **Model Implementation:** There were bugs in the code and missing sections that the authors claimed to have but did not. Additionally, running the TPC model in a notebook was buggy and slow.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Recommendations for Improving Reproducibility\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Documentation:** Provide detailed documentation for each step of the experiment, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Additionally, fully implement what is claimed in the code.\n",
        "- **Version Control:** Use a version control system to track changes in the code and include a `requirements.txt` file to specify the exact versions of libraries used.\n",
        "- **Environment Setup:** Update to newer versions of Python and simplify the pipeline to reduce compatibility issues. Ensure that the codebase is fully implemented and functional.\n",
        "- **Automated Testing:** Implement automated tests to verify that the code produces the expected outputs at each step.\n",
        "- **Clear Licensing:** Provide a clear license for the code and data to inform users of how they can use and modify the resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "By addressing these recommendations, the original authors and others in the field can enhance the reproducibility of their research, facilitating validation and further advancements in the area of ICU stay prediction.\n"
